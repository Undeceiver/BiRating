# BiRating
A rating algorithm for nodes in a bipartite graph where edges are given scores. For example, maps and players in a videogame.

This repository is currently not designed for others to understand and contribute to, as this is still in early stages. Reach out to me personally (undeceiver on Discord) if you are really interested in this.
