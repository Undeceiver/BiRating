# BiRating
A rating algorithm for nodes in a bipartite graph where edges are given scores. For example, maps and players in a videogame.

This repository is relatively easy to understand and extend, but is not particularly designed for collaboration. Reach out to me personally (undeceiver on Discord) if you are really interested in working on extending this.

See https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2502.19742 for a detailed account of the what, why, and how of this.
