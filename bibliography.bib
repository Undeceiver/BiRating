abstract = {Besides its NP-completeness, the strict constraints of subgraph isomorphism are making it impractical for graph pattern matching (GPM) in the context of big data. As a result, relaxed GPM models have emerged as they yield interesting results in a polynomial time. However, massive graphs generated by mostly social networks require a distributed storing and processing of the data over multiple machines, thus, requiring GPM to be revised by adopting new paradigms of big graphs processing, e.g., Think-Like-A-Vertex and its derivatives. This article discusses and proposes a classification of distributed GPM approaches with a narrow focus on the relaxed models.},

abstract = {Distributed processing of large-scale graph data has many practical applications and has been widely studied. In recent years, a lot of distributed graph processing frameworks and algorithms have been proposed. While many efforts have been devoted to analyzing these, with most analyzing them based on programming models, less research focuses on understanding their challenges in distributed environments. Applying graph tasks to distributed environments is not easy, often facing numerous challenges through our analysis, including parallelism, load balancing, communication overhead, and bandwidth. In this article, we provide an extensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in this field by outlining the challenges and solutions of distributed graph algorithms. We first conduct a systematic analysis of the inherent challenges in distributed graph processing, followed by presenting an overview of existing general solutions. Subsequently, we survey the challenges highlighted in recent distributed graph processing papers and the strategies adopted to address them. Finally, we discuss the current research trends and identify potential future opportunities.},

ABSTRACT = {Consensus-based data aggregation in d-regular bipartite graphs poses a challenging task for the scientific community since some of these algorithms diverge in this critical graph topology. Nevertheless, one can see a lack of scientific studies dealing with this topic in the literature. Motivated by our recent research concerned with this issue, we provide a comparative study of frequently applied consensus algorithms for distributed averaging in d-regular bipartite graphs in this paper. More specifically, we examine the performance of these algorithms with bounded execution in this topology in order to identify which algorithm can achieve the consensus despite no reconfiguration and find the best-performing algorithm in these graphs. In the experimental part, we apply the number of iterations required for consensus to evaluate the performance of the algorithms in randomly generated regular bipartite graphs with various connectivities and for three configurations of the applied stopping criterion, allowing us to identify the optimal distributed consensus algorithm for this graph topology. Moreover, the obtained experimental results presented in this paper are compared to other scientific manuscripts where the analyzed algorithms are examined in non-regular non-bipartite topologies.},

 abstract = {We study the iterative subgradient methods for nonsmooth convex constrained optimization problems in a uniformly convex and uniformly smooth Banach space, followed by metric and generalized projections onto the feasible sets. The normalized stepsizes αn are chosen apriori, satisfying the conditions $\Sigma _{n = 0}^\infty {\alpha _n} = \infty ,{\alpha _n} \to 0$. We prove that the every sequence generated in this way is weakly convergent to a minimizer in the average if the problem has solutions. In addition, we show that the perturbed ∊n-subgradient method is stable when ∊n → 0. More general case of variational inequalities with monotone (possibly) nonpotential operators is also considered.},
